# keymailer-chrome-extension
A Chrome Extension for keymailer

This chrome extension was written to make it easier to request keys at keymailer, it should not be used to fully script requesting keys. With this extension the user 
will still have to select each game they want individually.

## Installation:
In order to run this project on chrome you will need to clone the repo. Once you have done this go to chrome://extensions (make sure you have developer mode turned on), once there select load unpackaged and select the folder.

## Usage: 
Log into Keymailer and go to an area where you can request a key, once you request a key the extension will automatically select all platforms, then you will need to click the 
request button and the extension will handle the rest and bring you back to the main page to select other games.
